# Weekly git tagging

- [#2655](https://github.com/universal-ctags/ctags/pull/2655)
- [#1038](https://github.com/universal-ctags/ctags/issues/1038)

@masatake is implementing weekly automatic git tagging run at GitHub Actions.
Many people, especially binary packagers, have wanted official version tags.
Tag names will follow the form: v5.9._YYYYMMDD_.0.

**Updated:** The form of the tag names has been changed to p5.9._YYYYMMDD_.0, where "p" means periodical.

The action will not create a tag if no change is committed within a week
after the last tagging.
